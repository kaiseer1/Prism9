# Prism9 Framework Update v2.1

## Overview

**Prism9** is an AI-driven proactive cybersecurity framework that fuses threat detection, dynamic verification, and strategic deception into a unified defense strategy. Formerly known as **BlackWall**, the framework has been renamed to eliminate naming collisions, improve searchability, and align more closely with its core design philosophy — refracting threats like a prism and responding intelligently.

## Why the Name Change?

"BlackWall" was a strong initial identity, but it's widely used across the industry, limiting visibility and originality. "Prism9" offers:

* **Zero search collisions** — ensures branding clarity
* **Symbolic depth** — 'Prism' represents multi-layered detection & deception; '9' symbolizes modular architecture and finality
* **Memorability** — short, striking, and futuristic

## Core Modules of Prism9

1. **Reverse Zero-Day Algorithm (RZA)**: Detects previously unseen attack patterns using adaptive heuristics.
2. **Trust Verification Module (TVM)**: Assigns and dynamically recalculates trust scores for identities, sessions, and behaviors.
3. **False Positive Protocol (FPP)**: Introduces deception layers that verify alerts by observing attacker interaction.

Each module is loosely coupled yet interoperable, making Prism9 a modular, scalable platform.

## System Objectives

* **Proactive Defense**: Prevent, detect, and deceive — not just respond.
* **Low False Positives**: Maintain precision under adversarial pressure.
* **Modular Design**: Plug-and-play architecture for future integrations.

## Performance Summary (Based on CICIDS2017)

* Detection Accuracy: 96.2%
* False Positive Rate: 0%
* Engagement Deception Rate: 85.7%
