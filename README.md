## 🌟 Overview

**Prism9** (formerly BlackWall) is a next-generation AI-driven cybersecurity framework that revolutionizes threat detection and response through advanced deception techniques, adaptive machine learning, and zero-trust verification. Instead of simply blocking attacks, Prism9 makes them vanish into carefully orchestrated digital illusions.

### 🎯 Core Philosophy
> *"Where threats vanish before they begin"*
> 
> Transform cybersecurity from reactive defense to proactive threat nullification through intelligent deception and adaptive AI.

### ✨ Key Features

- **🧠 Predictive Threat Intelligence**: See attacks before they happen using ML models
- **🎭 Strategic Deception Engine**: Turn attackers against themselves with sophisticated honeypots
- **🔄 Adaptive Learning**: Evolves defenses in real-time based on attack patterns
- **📊 Zero-False-Positive Goal**: Convert alerts into actionable intelligence
- **⚡ High Performance**: 59% faster response times than traditional IDS systems

---

## 🏗️ Architecture: The Three Pillars

### 🔍 **RZA (Reverse Zero-day Algorithm)**
*ML-powered vulnerability prediction engine*
- **Anomaly Detection**: IsolationForest algorithms identify unusual patterns
- **Attack Classification**: RandomForest models categorize threat types
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Deep learning tracks attacker methodologies
- **Pattern Recognition**: Advanced regex and entropy-based detection

### 🛡️ **TVM (Zero-Trust Verification Module)**  
*Adaptive trust scoring that learns and evolves*
- **Dynamic Trust Calculation**: Real-time user behavior analysis
- **Context-Aware Decisions**: Location, time, and pattern-based evaluation
- **Continuous Authentication**: Ongoing verification without friction
- **Risk Profiling**: Multi-dimensional threat assessment

### 🎭 **FPP (False Positive Protocol)**
*Strategic deception engine that weaponizes false alerts*
- **Tar Pits**: Progressive delays to exhaust attackers
- **Honey Traps**: Fake databases capturing intelligence
- **Phantom Portals**: Convincing decoy interfaces
- **Canary Tokens**: Hidden triggers revealing reconnaissance

## 🔬 Scientific Foundation

### 📚 Mathematical Framework

**Core Decision Algorithm:**
```
Response = {
  Deceive + Block,  if δ(t) > μ+kσ AND T(u,c) < τ AND F(x) > θ
  Enhanced Monitor, if δ(t) > μ+kσ AND T(u,c) ≥ τ  
  Normal Process,   if δ(t) ≤ μ+kσ
}
```

**Where:**
- `δ(t)` = Threat deviation at time t
- `μ, σ` = Statistical baseline and variance
- `T(u,c)` = Trust score for user u in context c
- `F(x)` = False positive transformation function
